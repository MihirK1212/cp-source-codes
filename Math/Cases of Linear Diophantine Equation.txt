=> Basic Case:

Given: ax + by = c

1) Use extended euclidean algorithm to find (U,V) s.t. aU + bV = g
2) Now, if c mod g = 0, aU * (c/g) + bV * (c/g) = c
3) Hence, one solution is ( U*(c/g) , V*(c/g) )

Let this solution be (x0,y0)
Hence a*x0 + b*y0 = c


=> All solutions:

All solutions will be of the form (x0 - k*(b/g) , (y0 + k*(a/g))

=> Solution with minimum (x+y) :

Using previous relation, we get :
x + y = x0 + y0 + k*((b-a)/g)

If  a < b , we need to select smallest possible value of  k. 
If  a > b , we need to select the largest possible value of  k .
If  a = b , all solution will have the same sum  x + y .


=> Check if positive solution exists:

1) If x0 and y0 both have the same sign, you're done.
If they are both positive, you have positive solutions,
If they are both negative, you don't.

2) If x0 and y0 have different signs, choose the smallest (in absolute value) k to change the sign of the negative integer.
That is, if x0 is negative, then take k = floor(d * x0 / b) (rounding to -infinity)
and if is y0 is negative, take k = ceil(-d * y0 / a)

3) Compute (x1,y1) = (x0 - k * b / d , y0 + k * a / d)
If x1 and y1 are both positive, you just found two positive integer solutions.
If flipping the sign of one number flipped the other one, you can not find positive solutions.
