1) GCD of two nums * LCM of two nums = Product of two nums

2) If gcd(a,b) = d then gcd(a/d,b/d) = 1

3) The bezout's identity states that if d = gcd(a,b) then there always exist integers x and y such that ax+by = d. 
(Of course, the theory of linear diophantine equations assures existance of infinitely many solutions, if one exists). 
It is also worth noting that k=d is the smallest positive integer for which ax+by = k has a solution with integral x and y.

4) The most commonly used algorithm for the integer factorization is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
It is sufficient to scan primes upto sqrt(N) while factorizing N. 
Also, if we need to factorize all numbers between 1 to N, this task can be done using a single run of this algorithm -
 For every integer k between 1 to N, we can maintain a single pair - the smallest prime that divides k, and its highest power , say (p,a). 
The remaining prime factors of k are then same as that of k/(pa).

5) x % y < (x/2)  if x>=y
