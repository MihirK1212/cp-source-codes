Let us initially create an array diff of zeroes of size n+2. We assume that l, r are 1-indexed. Now for every query, we do the following: add x to diff[l] and subtract x from diff[r+1] (diff is 0-indexed). After all the queries are over, we take the prefix sum over diff, and what we get is finally the amout that needs to be added to the original array a to obtain the final array after all queries.
