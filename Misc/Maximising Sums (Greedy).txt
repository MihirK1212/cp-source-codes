6.4 Minimizing sums
We next consider a problem where we are given n numbers a1,a2,...,an and our
task is to find a value x that minimizes the sum
|a1 − x|
c +|a2 − x|
c +··· +|an − x|
c
.
We focus on the cases c = 1 and c = 2.
Case c = 1
In this case, we should minimize the sum
|a1 − x| +|a2 − x| +··· +|an − x|.
For example, if the numbers are [1,2,9,2,6], the best solution is to select x = 2
which produces the sum
|1−2| +|2−2| +|9−2| +|2−2| +|6−2| = 12.
In the general case, the best choice for x is the median of the numbers, i.e., the
middle number after sorting. For example, the list [1,2,9,2,6] becomes [1,2,2,6,9]
after sorting, so the median is 2.
The median is an optimal choice, because if x is smaller than the median, the
sum becomes smaller by increasing x, and if x is larger then the median, the
sum becomes smaller by decreasing x. Hence, the optimal solution is that x is
the median. If n is even and there are two medians, both medians and all values
between them are optimal choices.
Case c = 2
In this case, we should minimize the sum
(a1 − x)^2
+(a2 − x)^2 
+··· +(an − x)

For example, if the numbers are [1,2,9,2,6], the best solution is to select x = 4
which produces the sum
(1−4)2 +(2−4)2 +(9−4)2 +(2−4)2 +(6−4)2 = 46.
In the general case, the best choice for x is the average of the numbers. In the
example the average is (1 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 6)/5 = 4. This result can be derived by
presenting the sum as follows:
nx2 −2x(a1 + a2 +··· + an)+(a
2
1 + a
2
2 +··· + a

)
The last part does not depend on x, so we can ignore it. The remaining parts
form a function nx2 −2xs where s = a1 + a2 +··· + an. This is a parabola opening
upwards with roots x = 0 and x = 2s/n, and the minimum value is the average of
the roots x = s/n, i.e., the average of the numbers a1,a2,...,an.
